This is my CISC482 IA08 assignment: doodleCanvas, developed with Android Studio and JetPack Compose.

The main goal of doodleCanvas is to enable the user to draw on their phones.

Key features:
  1. Drawable canva
  2. Tool Panel with 8 different brush colors(default is black) and adjustable brush size(1px to 50px, default is 10px)
  3. Clear button to clear the drawings
  4. **New feature: Undo button to undo the last drawn stroke

Side effects: On top of the tool panel, there is a hint message that displays "✅ Ready" when the canva is ready for the user to draw;
once the user is drawing, it will displays "🎨 Drawing..." to tells the user the canva is working properly.

Instruction to use is simple: just your fingers :>
Enjoy your drawings!!!
